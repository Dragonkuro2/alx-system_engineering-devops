# 0x0B. SSH

## Description
This project focuses on understanding SSH (Secure Shell) and its usage in DevOps, network administration, and security contexts. You will learn about creating and using SSH RSA key pairs, connecting to remote hosts securely, and the advantages of using SSH.

## Authored

This project made by [Hicham Bourezi](https://github.com/Dragonkuro2).

## Background Context
In this project, you will connect to an Ubuntu server using SSH with RSA key authentication. The server details are provided in the "my servers" section of the intranet. Your server is configured with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the concept of a server and its location
- Explain SSH and its importance in secure communication
- Create SSH RSA key pairs
- Connect to remote hosts securely using SSH RSA key pairs
- Understand the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Requirements
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Format:** All files should end with a new line
- **README:** A README.md file at the root of the folder is mandatory
- **Script Permissions:** All Bash script files must be executable
- **Script Header:** The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- **Script Comments:** The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose
